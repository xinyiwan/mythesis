\chapter{Conclusion}
In this study, we proposed rCOMMIT as a method to study the performance of 
filtering method COMMIT and give assessment on individual streamlines. 
Additionally, the pseudo ground truth for the input data is generated with rCOMMIT, which 
is used as training data for the deep learning-based classifiers.
The classifiers are applied to binary and multi-classes classification tasks and 
show the potential of deep learning method in filtering. 
It learns the characteristics of different type of streamlines (plausible, implausible, and inconclusive) 
and speeds up the filtering process.
