\chapter{Theoretical Background}


In this chapter, theoretical background of this project will be introduced in details. To better introduce the importance of the filtering, a big picture of the pipeline of tractography will be first presented. 

\section{Diffusion MRI}

Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive method to track the molecules diffusion in biological tissues. As molecules interact with many different obstacles as they diffuse throughout tissues, dMRI provides insight into the microscopic details of tissue architecture \cite{newmanChapterMorphologicalBrain2014}.
